        <h2>Elon Musk Sells Entire Tech Empire to Kuldeep Singh,
            Pleads for a Job and a Homemade Meal</h2>
            <article>
        <h4>April 22, 2025 | Global Tech Times</h4>
        <p>In a twist no one saw coming, tech mogul Elon Musk 
            has officially sold his entire empire—including Tesla, 
            SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), Neuralink, and The Boring
             Company—to none other than rising tech sensation Mr. Kuldeep Singh.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sources say the deal, valued at over $800 billion, 
            was sealed in a private 5-minute Zoom call where Musk,
             appearing visibly exhausted and slightly hungry, 
             muttered the now-viral phrase: “Kuldeep, please… 
             just give me a desk job. And maybe a roti or two.”
        </p>
            </article>
       
        <h4>What Triggered the Sale?</h4>
        <p>Insiders reveal that after a string of chaotic tweets, 
             Mars rocket malfunctions, and a mysterious AI that 
             refused to stop rapping in binary, Musk decided it 
             was time to pass the torch. Meanwhile, Kuldeep 
             Singh—known for his groundbreaking work in fake
              news detection and AI ethics—had quietly built a 
              tech empire of his own, one algorithm at a time.

            “Frankly, he’s a genius,” said one former Tesla 
            executive. “Kuldeep doesn’t just think outside
             the box—he recycles the box, programs it to walk,
              and teaches it to detect misinformation in under 
              five seconds.”
            
            </p>

       
        <h4>The Kuldeep Era Begins</h4>
        <p>With the stroke of a digital pen and a slightly 
            laggy internet connection, Kuldeep Singh assumed 
            control of some of the most influential companies
             on Earth—and beyond. Within hours of the transition,
              Singh was spotted walking calmly into Tesla’s 
              Fremont headquarters, wearing a simple kurta
              and sneakers, where employees greeted him with
               stunned applause and a plate of samosas.</p>
         
        <h4>What's Next?</h4>
        <p>Singh has already teased his next big move: 
            integrating Tesla AI into community farming 
            networks, developing eco-friendly Mars habitats, 
            and re-launching Vine “just because it's fun.”
            His 5-year plan, casually shared via an Instagram Story,
            includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teaching AI to respect aunties</li>
                <li>Building ethical robots that don't
                 secretly want world domination</li>
                <li>Releasing a collaborative mixtape
                 with ChatGPT</li>
                <li>Giving every Tesla the ability to 
                make buttered toast mid-drive</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>As for Musk? He's working on a new invention 
            in Kuldeep's garage—some kind of quantum-powered spice grinder. When asked about his new journey, he simply said:
            <p>“This might be the most ambitious project I’ve ever been a part of. Also, I think I just tasted the best dal in my life.”</p>
